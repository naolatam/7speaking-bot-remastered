# 7speaking-bot-remastered
The 7speaking bot but remastered with some delay and more invisible from anti-cheat

# WARNING!
This script is not working anymore. There is absolutly no more automatism due to 7speaking.
7Speaking enable an anti-bot on all exams and training, and the actual script cannot pass this.

I'm working on a new version. In first, it will be exclusive for toeic, and will be available for other later.
This version will theorically bypass the anti-bot protection.
The code will also be refactor, so it's become more easy to read it and edit it!
I'll also do a 'guide to use' for this!
