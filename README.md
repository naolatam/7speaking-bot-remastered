# 7speaking-bot-remastered
The 7speaking bot but remastered with some delay and more invisible from anti-cheat

# WARNING!
This script is not working anymore. There is absolutly no more automatism due to 7speaking.
7Speaking enable an anti-bot on all exams and training, and the actual script cannot pass this.

I'm working on a new version. In first, it will be exclusive for toeic, and will be available for other later.
This version will theorically bypass the anti-bot protection.
The code will also be refactor, so it's become more easy to read it and edit it!
I'll also do a 'guide to use' for this!

15/01/25 | 21h:36 (Paris): I've bypass 7speaking anti-bot service :) Bot will come back soon for toeic only! <br>
15/01/25 | 23h:07 (Paris): The bot is now stable! I will try it a little more time and start developping other mode (like quizz, linguaskill, etc, etc) <br>
15/01/25 | 23h:32 (Paris): I get in front of a big trouble. I'm always only able to make the first test... I'm searching for the difference in the request and how to get it.
